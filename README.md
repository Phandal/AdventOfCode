# Advent Of Code Projects
Repo contains the things I wrote to solve the [AOC](https://adventofcode.com) for different languages

## Description
The structure of this repo is such that each each year has its own directory. Inside that each language has its own directory. Inside that each day has its own directory. Inside that directory, there are typically these 4 files:
1. input.txt - the actual input that I got from AOC
2. test_input.txt - the file that contains the values used in the example from AOC
3. part1.\* - Part1 source code
4. part2.\* - Part2 source code

Most language directories will have an explanation on how to run the program!
